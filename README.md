# Dani Di Donato's Portfolio  

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio, built using **React**.  

## Technologies Used  

- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.  
- **Vite**: Development environment for faster builds.  
- **CSS**: Used for styling, including simple animations and subtle color highlights.  
- **Vercel**: Platform for deployment and hosting.  
- **JSON**: Used for storing data.  

## Project Highlights  

- Single-page application with smooth navigation using `<a>` tags for section linking.  
- Minimalist and contemporary design, with a focus on readability and simplicity.  
- Subtle color highlights to emphasize key actions: navigating to projects, exploring sections, viewing project repositories, and accessing main links (email, LinkedIn, GitHub).  
- Dynamically loads project data from a JSON file.
